    %Q(
      One grey elephant balancing
      Step by step on a piece of string
      Thought it was such a wonderful stunt
      That he called for another elephant

      Two grey elephants balancing
      Step by step on a piece of string
      Thought it was such a wonderful stunt
      That they called for another elephant

      Three grey elephants balancing
      Step by step on a piece of string 
      Thought it was such a wonderful stunt
      That they called for another elephant

      Four grey elephants balancing
      Step by step on a piece of string
      Thought it was such a wonderful stunt
      That they called for another elephant

      Five grey elephants balancing
      Step by step on a piece of string
      All of a sudden the piece of string broke
      And down came all the elephant folk
    )
